# Very-Simple-AI
Simple AI
This is a very simple AI that can respond with one of five pre-defined answers: "yes", "no", "maybe", "IDK", and "of course".

Usage
To use this AI, simply run the simple_ai.py script. You can ask the AI a question by typing it in the console, and the AI will respond with one of the pre-defined answers.

Customization
If you want to customize the AI's responses, you can edit the answers list in the simple_ai.py script. Just make sure to keep the list length the same, as the AI selects a response randomly based on the list length.
